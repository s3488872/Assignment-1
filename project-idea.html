  <h1>My Profile</h1>
  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>There are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of mobile travel apps on the market – all taking care of different aspects of a trip, from apps that help you book hotels and flights, to organisational apps that store your important documents and itineraries – there are even apps for finding camping spots, planning road trips, and preventing jet-lag! But what about a mobile travel app for travel? One that allows the user to view at a glance the most popular transport apps used in the country they’ll be visiting, download them before they leave home, and uninstall them once done. And in the next country? And so on and so forth? What if this was available for any and all countries? Users would not need to worry about how to get to their accommodation once they land; or desperately try to download the app they need over slow and unprotected airport Wi-Fi.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>There is always a lot of research to be done before visiting a new country – where to stay, where to visit, where to eat, WHAT to eat… the list goes on. How are travellers going to get to all these places? What if they want to catch public transport, perhaps local buses, trams, or metro trains? Is there an app for that? Or maybe they need to take long-haul buses between cities. Where could they find if this service exists? What’s it called? The app’s goal is to take some of the guesswork out for travellers trying to navigate the world of navigation in foreign countries, the only time they’d want to focus on the destination, rather than the journey.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The app would run on Android initially, and most of its service would run off and link to the Google Play Store. Within the app, the initial user-interface would be simple and feature a list of all countries’ names in alphabetical order that users can scroll down through to find their desired country (screen no. 1).</p>
<p>Once a country is selected/touched, the app takes you to a new screen (screen no. 2 - still within the app) of a list of the most popular transport apps used in that country – grouped by and listed in categories (with green headers for each category element). The order and names of these categories would be the same across all countries’ pages and could be listed alphabetically or intuitively/based off most popular to least popular categories. This list of apps and categories would not be exhaustive and therefore it would be acceptable to list the categories in a way that is not alphabetical, as users would not need to scroll much to find their desired category. Category names would include: “Public Transport”, “Taxis”, “Rideshare”, “Coaches/Long-haul Buses”, “Rail/Long-haul/High-speed Trains”, etc. - or these could be taken one step further and broken down into smaller categories, such as: “Public Transport – Metro”, “Public Transport – Buses”, “Public Transport – Trams”; “High-speed Rail”, “Sleeper Trains”. Still on the same screen, under each category header, is a preview of the names of apps (listed; alphabetically) for that service, available and widely used in that country. As only popular apps are featured throughout the app, the apps being listed alphabetically on this screen should not affect the standard of service the user will get should they choose to go with the app beginning with ‘A’ versus the app beginning with ‘J’. The apps listed under a category would all be different companies/competitors who offer the same/similar type and standard of service. But if there might be concerns with this for the end-user’s real-world/resulting experience (thereby having a negative bearing on the app itself), these apps could instead be listed by popularity ranking (within their categories).</p>
<p>Once an app is selected from this list on this screen, the app would then take the user to another screen (screen no. 3), which would give a short description of the feature app - what it is/what it does/what the user needs to do (i.e. make an account to use the app, buy a transport card to use alongside the app, make a booking) and which company it refers to and services (name of company). Below this description would be the Google Play Store icon (Figure 1), which would redirect the user to the Play Store where they could then download the app and read about it further/read reviews. The interface on this page would be clean and clear with not too much information; rather an overview of the app.</p>
<p>Other features could include are breadcrumbs; GPS tracker; favourites/the ability to bookmark/save countries and apps; a footer navigation menu; and the ability to create a user account to save your favourite countries and apps. These same steps, layout and features would be followed if the app was also to be launched on iOS – with an iOS App Store icon to the right of the Play Store icon (see Figure 2) on the description page (screen no. 3); serving the same purpose to redirect you to the iOS App Store when clicked/touched.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>Android Studio would be used to build this app. Hardware required to run Android Studio would be a PC with ideally a minimum of 8GB RAM and core i5 processor. Other helpful hardware would be an SSD and of course a smartphone running Android. The Linux OS might be better suited to running Android Studio rather than Windows (Zoha, A. & Lazar, A. 2018 & 2020). CAD tools such as Adobe Illustrator/Adobe Photoshop could be used to design the visuals/screens, Balsamiq for wireframes, Postman for web service testing, and Selenium for UI tests.</p>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>Skills required for this project would include the ability to write Java in order to develop the app using Android Studio, and knowledge of REST API for web services. CAD skills would also be beneficial in designing the visual diagrams/mock-ups of screens. Java scripting skills could be sourced externally. Hardware and software required would be possible to attain. Sourcing, maintaining and ensuring accuracy of information might pose a challenge as there would be a lot of information required to make this app. Each country would need to be researched and would require multiple entries (that need to be validated) – this would be time-consuming and a large data set to collate and manage.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If the project is successful, it would fill a gap in the market as there does not seem to be a smartphone app like this (or at least not one that is well-known and widely-used). Unlike other common categories that travel apps fall under [and therefore have many competitors within], this category of a travel app seems to be more unique. It would be an important and useful dataset if the project did come together. It would also positively impact the tourism industry globally, as well as Google Play Store and all featured apps’ developers/teams and their respective companies.</p>
